He has h/o MI, COPD, HTN, DM, hyperlipemia, and osteoporosis. His past medical history includes CHF, PE, and pneumothorax.\n\nIn the ED his CXR revealed left lower lobar consolidation and he received an ABX regimen and was treated for presumptive sepsis. He was started on Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl. He was then transferred to the ICU where he continued to receive these ABX. The following day his CXR revealed that there was now bilateral pleural effusions which were drained through thoracentesis. He was discharged home but returned to the hospital yesterday after experiencing increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, and general malaise. His WBC count was elevated at 14.1, lactic acid level was 3.1, and his creatinine level increased from 1.2 to 1.4. He was readmitted to the ICU and his sputum sample was sent for culture. His sputum results have been negative so far.\n\nHis current assessment shows him alert and oriented x 3, pleasant, and cooperative with care although slightly anxious about his condition. His vital signs are stable with normal blood pressures, a normal temperature of 99.2 degrees, a respiratory rate of 17-21 breaths per minute, and a regular rhythm with occasional PVC's. His oxygen saturation is 97-100 percent on two liters via nasal canula. He does have some intermittent wheezes but they appear to be related to his anxiety rather than his breathing pattern since they resolve quickly upon reassurance. He is able to take deep cleansing breaths and he denies having any chest pain. He has a positive bowel sound with no evidence of active bleeding. His urinary output is greater than 30 cc per hour and his glucose levels remain within acceptable limits. He continues to receive ceftriaxone, flagyl, and levofloxacin. His skin is intact and he has a peripheral line placed.\n\nHe will need further evaluation of his cardiopulmonary function prior to being transferred out of the hospital. He may require a CT scan of his lungs and possibly even a bronchoscopy. If he is cleared for transfer to another unit he will likely go to the telemetry service because of his age."}

She was brought to OSH where she had an episode of hypotension (BP 60) requiring volume resuscitation with NS boluses. She also received 2 units PRBCs for low hemoglobin level. She then developed SOB and desats requiring intubation and admission to ICU. In ICU she was placed on CPAP due to persistency of desaturation which resolved over course of night. This morning pt became tachypneic with increasing ABG abnormalities. She was weaned off CPAP and started on BiPAp but continued to have increased work of breathing with decreased oxygenation resulting in reintroduction of CPAP.

He has a history of CVA x3 (L sided weakness), L femoral DVT, R hemiparesis, obesity, HTN, DM2, COPD, and depression. Pt was found down by wife and brought to EW. Pt had been taking warfarin since [**8-6**], but held dose last night. In EW, pt noted to have increased SOB and decreased O2 saturation to 90%. He also developed acute chest pain radiating up into neck area which resolved spontaneously within minutes. Pt was given 4 mg IV Lasix bolus and started on NS infusion. Chest X-ray revealed ? pneumonia vs aspiration pneumonia and pt was transferred to MICU-A for closer monitoring. Upon arrival to MICU-A, pt noted to be tachycardiac and tachypneic with HR 104, BP 150/60, RR 34, SpO2 96% on room air and SaO2 95% with 2 liters NC. Pt was placed on NIV for comfort measures. Pt did improve slightly with NIV but remained tachycardiac with HR 100's despite multiple doses of PO lopressor. Pt became increasingly confused and restless requiring frequent repositioning. Pt was then switched over to bilevel CPAP with good results. Pt was also given 2 gm IV magnesium sulfate for hypokalemia. Pt was also started on Levoquin for possible UTI as urine culture showed positive growth of Enterobacteriaceae.

Her pregnancy was uncomplicated until today when she presented to the ED with abdominal pain and fever.  She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery without analgesic medication and no intrapartum antibiotics were administered. The infant emerged vigorous and pink.  He was bulb suctioned and stimulated.  There was no resuscitation required but he developed bradycardia requiring CPAP support.  He also received BBO2 for desaturations.  His HR improved and his oxygen saturation stabilized on room air.  After transfer from L&D he became tachypneic and hyperthermic and was transferred back to the ER where his O2 sats dropped into the high 80s's despite CPAP supplemental O2.  His respiratory status continued to deteriorate over several hours.  He then began to have periods of apnea lasting up to one minute followed by episodes of bradycardias.  He responded well to bagging but remained hypoxemic.  His blood pressure was stable during these events and there was no evidence of seizure activity.  15 minutes after birth he was given IV amp/gent and started on CPAP supplemental O2.  He was transferred to the NICU for further management.\n\nPhysical Exam - Infant appears comfortable on CPAP support.  VSS.  Skin is pale, slightly jaundiced.  HEENT non-focal and normal appearing.

[/INST]Neonatology Attending Admission Note\n\nBaby Girl [**Known lastname 5687**] is a term infant admitted to the NICU for management of TTS and evaluation of cardiac status. She was born at 0923 today as the 4085 gram product of a 37 [**4-18**] week gestation pregnancy to a 31 y.o. G2P1 mother with blood type B positive, antibody negative (Rubella Immune).  Prenatal course significant only for maternal fever on [**2111-1-23**].\n\nMother presented in spontaneous labor this morning after receiving epidural anesthesia.  Maternal temperature remained elevated throughout labor.  Infant emerged vigorous but had mild respiratory distress requiring suctioning and blow by oxygen.  Apgars were 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.  She was transferred uneventfully to the Newborn Nursery.  Approximately three hours later she developed increasing work of breathing and intermittent grunting which prompted her transfer to the NICU.\n\nOn arrival to the NICU infant was noted to be pink, comfortable in room air, with clear BS bilaterally.  RR in the 30's with O2 sats >97%.  No murmur appreciated.  VSS.  Abdomen benign.  Genitalia unremarkable.  CBC and blood culture obtained; pending.  D-stick=83.

He was admitted to ICU after being transferred from ER. His hx includes vascular dementia, chronic kidney disease with HD, COPD, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. In ER his temp max was 101.4, lactic acid level was 2.3, CRP was elevated, and blood cultures revealed streptococcus pneumoniae. He received ceftriaxone and azithromycin in ER.\nOn arrival to ICU he was tachypneic, tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxemic requiring vent support. He also developed acidosis and hyperkalemia which were treated with bicarb drip and insulin drip. The team decided not to intubate him because of high probability of aspiration risk. They felt it would be too difficult to wean off ventilator if he did get intubated.\nHe required multiple doses of Neobuffalat neb treatments for severe expiratory wheeze. This morning he desaturated into mid 80's when he attempted to remove o2 mask. He was given an additional dose of Nebu and then placed back on nonrebreather mask where his sats remain stable at 96%.\nHis mental status has been inconsistent since admission. At times he appears alert and follows all commands but other times he seems confused and does not respond to verbal stimulation. He will occasionally answer yes to questions but most often he will not speak. Occasionally he will make appropriate movements such as raising both hands above head when asked if he can hear me, but otherwise he is very lethargic. His speech is garbled sounding and sometimes hard to understand. He has not spoken any words today.\nIn addition to the above symptoms he has also become increasingly agitated during the last few hours. He is pulling at lines and trying to sit up in bed. When he is left alone he gets out of bed and tries to pull out his own iv line. He becomes extremely combative and aggressive towards staff and even himself. We have tried several different drugs including hydralazine and lopressor without much effect.

Prenatal screens were complete and unremarkable including negative fetal echo, A-, AB+, HepBSAg-, RPRNR, RI, GBS-. This pregnancy was notable for gestational diabetes, which was well controlled on diet alone throughout pregnancy. Spontaneous labor leading to induction with pitocin. Delivery by vacuum assisted vaginal delivery resulting in apgar scores of 9(1min)/9(5min), and transitioned to the newborn nursery without complication. On day of life #7, infant became increasingly somnolent and developed mild retractions, grunting with some intermittent desaturations despite being placed on a heated open crib. Infant was transferred to the NICU for evaluation and treatment of presumed transient surfactant deficiency. Upon arrival to the NICU, infant was noted to have mildly diminished aeration of the left lung field, otherwise appeared clinically stable with SaO2 >92%, and no bradies. Infant was placed on CPAP 6 cmH2O and FiO2 titrated up to maintain SaO2 >92%. After several hours of observation, infant began to become more somulent and develop occasional apneas, desaturating down to high 70's. Infant responded promptly to tactile and oral simulation, however, continued to desaturate to 70's even with CPAP and 100% FiO2. Decision made to intubate infant and administer surfactant therapy. At that time, infant weighed 2695 gms and was 19 inches long. Infant was placed under general anesthesia and intubated with a 3.5 ETT secured at 7.5 cm. Following placement, infant was given 5 cc bolus of Survanta followed by 4 doses every 6 hours of Beractant. Infant was then transported to NICU warmer for monitoring and followup.\n\nSince arrival to the NICU, infant continues on CPAP 6 cmH2O with 100% FiO2. Initial SaO2 92-94%, currently 95-100% with minimal drifts to low 90's with desaturation. Vent settings are currently CMV mode with RR 40-50, TV 230-250, and Vt 6-7 mls. Che"}

Her SOB persisted despite being treated with lasix IVP x2 and furosemide PO x2. She also developed a cough and sputum production. She was brought into EW where she was found to be tachycardic up to 180's with HR 90's, BP 60's systolic, O2 sat 78-80%. She received 4mg of Lasix and 2L NS bolus which improved her symptoms. CXR showed pulmonary edema and pt started receiving levophed gtt. She was then transferred to ICU for closer monitoring. In the ICU, pt was given additional diuretics and fluid boluses with improvement in her O2 sats to mid-high 90's. She remained stable overnight until this morning when her O2 requirement increased to high flow neb and O2 sats dropped down to low 90's. Pts's ABG revealed respiratory acidosis. Pt was placed on CPAP and given bipap mask. She tolerated both well without any distress. She remains on Levo gtt and will continue to monitor her closely.

She was subsequently transferred to MICU for further evaluation. Overnight she continued to receive pressors and diuretics for persistent hypotension with poor response to volume replacement. At approximately 11pm she experienced an episode of bradycardia requiring cardioversion. This was followed shortly by another episode of bradycardia requiring dopamine infusion. The next day she was again hypotensive and desaturated requiring multiple pressor titrations and diuretic dosing. She was eventually able to maintain adequate BP and saturation with dopamine and milrinone drip. Today, she was extubated and is now awaiting transfer to the floor. Please see carevue for details.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nCardiac: Pt has history of cong heart failure, hypertension, and COPD. She was initially on coumadin for DVT but was switched over to heparin because of recent bleeding in her intestines. She has a central line in place. She is currently being monitored with telemetry, CVP, ICP, PA pressure and filling, CO/CI, and SVR. She has been on dopamine and milrinone drips since yesterday. Dopamine was stopped this AM after pt was weaned off pressors. Milrinone was titrated to 1 mcg/kg/min this AM after pt was extubated. Plan to stop it later this AM. She is currently receiving 5 mg lasix PO QD.\n\nRespiratory: Pt is on 2 liters NC and maintaining saturations greater than 95%. She has had periods of wheezing that have resolved spontaneously. Plan to start steroids today.\n\nGI: PT is NPO at present. She has been passing small amounts of brown liquid stools. She is getting colace and lactulose.\n\nGU: Pt voiding adequately through foley catheter. She is receiving 20 meq KCL daily while on the milrinone drip.

[/INST]Nursing Note\nPt admitted to TSICU for further management after transfer from floor.  Pt is a 57yo male w/ extensive PMHx including metastatic castrate prostatic adenocarcinoma, s/p bilateral hip arthroplasty x2, CABG x4, HTN, DM II, CHF, AFib, COPD, OSA, and depression; recent hospitalization on [**6-9**].  Pt had an episode of acute hypoxic resp distress requiring intubation and admission to the ICU where he was found to be in acute renal failure, hypokalemic, hyponatremic and hypercalcemic, and required dialysis.  On day 3 post-admission pt developed a fever, leukopenia, and increased lactate levels. He then experienced a syncopal event which led him to the EW. There his BP dropped to 60's and he became hypotensive requiring IV fluids and dopamine gtt. His K+ level continued to rise despite fluid resuscitation. He received several doses of amiodarone as well as multiple doses of calcium gluconate. His BP remained labile until he began receiving norepinephrine. He also required mechanical ventilation due to resp compromise. The team discussed options for treatment but decided that it would be futile at this point.\n\nNeuro: Pt remains sedated on propofol at 40mcg/kg/min. Pupils are pinpoint and sluggishly responsive. No spontaneous movement noted thus far today.\nCV: HR has been tachycardic ranging between 110-140's, mostly SR with occassional runs of VT. Pts' BP has been labile throughout the night with SBP ranging between 80's and 180's. It appears that when the BP drops below 80, the HR will increase above 100. When BP rises to > 140 HR decreases back down into the low teens or 20's. Nipride drip started at 2pm yesterday and titrated up to .1mcg/.kg/min over course of afternoon/evening. This morning the NIPRIDE drip was stopped and pt's BP was able to maintain itself without any intervention. The LR infusion continues at 5cc/hr.\nResp: Pt currently remains intubated and mechanically ventilated on settings of AC mode with rate of 14 and TV of 500. FiO2 weaned to 40%. Suctioned q1h for scant amounts of thick yellow secretions. ABG results have been stable overnight. Chest Xray done last evening revealed no change in parenchymal lung edema.\nGI: Abd soft, + BS, - BM.

[/INST]Admission Note\nBaby Girl [**Known lastname 4258**] is the 39 week gestation product of a singleton gestation born by SVD to a 36 year old mother with PMH notable for MS and HIV. Prenatal screens were complete and unremarkable including blood type B positive antibody negative. Mother presented in labor at home this am. She was transferred to [**Last Name (un) **]. Upon arrival she had spontaneous delivery. Infant emerged vigorous with good tone. Apgar scores were 7 at one minute and 9 at five minutes. The infant was brought to the newborn nursery where she was noted to have poor sucking. She was transferred to the NICU for further evaluation. On admission to the NICU she was alert but lethargic. Her color was pale pink and her perfusion was fair. There was no evidence of respiratory distress or retracting while awake. Her HR was 100's and RR was 40-60. No murmur was audible on auscultation. Lungs were clear bilaterally. She remained in room air throughout the shift. Abdomen was soft with active bowel sounds. She voided upon arrival. She did not stool during the first two hours of life. Blood glucose was normal at 35. CBC showed a hemoglobin level of 11.4, platelet count of 219k and a white cell count of 20.6k. Platelets were sent for analysis.

She did wake up several times throughout the night asking for more meds. Her anxiety level increased during these periods and required multiple reassurances that she would survive this. At one point, the resident stated that there may be a chance that she could possibly go home today depending on results of scans done yesterday and the need for any additional interventions. The pt became extremely upset over being sent home today and asked for another sedation med, which was refused by the resident. She continued to become agitated and requested that they turn off the lights because she wanted to sleep. They turned off the lights and placed her back on dillaudid gtt and she fell back asleep. She woke again approx two hours later requesting another dose of dillaudid. The team discussed her increasing anxiety levels and decided to hold the meds until morning rounds were finished.

She was treated with betamethasone x two doses prior to delivery. Antenatal labs were as follows - B positive, antibody negative, Hepatitis b surface antigen negaitve, Rubella immune, RPR non reactive. No other significant medical history or medication use noted. Family history notable for maternal hypothyroidism.\n\nAntenatal course - [**Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 232**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]. [**Name (NI) 111**] for EDC [**2088-3-32**]. This pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios diagnosed at approximately 31 weeks gestational age. Maternal blood pressure was within normal limits. Fetal ultrasound revealed no evidence of cardiac enlargement or abnormal fetal growth patterns. There have been no episodes of vaginal bleeding or fever. The decision to deliver this baby today was taken on clinical grounds due to concern about further deterioration of amniotic fluid status.\n\nDelivery - Infant was delivered via C Section under general anaesthesia.

He was then transferred to the neonatology service where his initial exam revealed him to be pink, well perfused, with a normal capillary refill, a soft abdomen without masses, breath sounds clear equal bilaterally, and a murmur audible only on auscultation. His testosterone level was 10 ng/ml, his thyroid hormones were within limits, his blood sugar was 72, and his CK level was <500 ng/ml. His length was 19 inches and his weight was 2950 grams.\n\nHis evaluation here has included a chest X-ray that showed normal lung fields, a head CT scan which showed no evidence of cerebrovascular disease, and a lumbar puncture which was performed under sterile conditions. This procedure did not reveal any bleeding from the spinal canal. The results are pending. An echocardiogram also showed normal cardiac structure and no evidence of pulmonic valve stenosis.\n\nHe is currently being monitored in a stable condition in a regular nursery room.\n\nPE: Vigorous appearing term infant in no distress, breathing comfortably without difficulty\nHEENT: NCAT, eyes slightly wide open\nChest: breath sound clear, no crackles\nCV: RRR, normal first heart sound, no audible murmur\nAbd: soft, nondistended, +BS\nExtremities: symmetrical movement, no contractures, right hand clavicle appears more prominent than left side, both wrists palpable with radial pulse present bilaterally\nGU: testes descended bilaterally\nAnus: patent\nNeuro: tone appropriate, symmetric movements, suck and grasp intact, Moro equal\nHips: stable\nSpine: midline, no dimple\nClavicles: right clavicle appears larger than the left, but palpable with strong bimanual pressure\n\nIMPRESSION: Term male infant with a large clavicular defect and mild asymmetry of the neck and head.\n\nPLAN: Continue to monitor for signs of neurologic deficit. If these symptoms persist, will obtain further neuroimaging studies including a magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine and brain. Will consider repeat echocardiography if there are concerns about the vascular integrity of the subclavian vessels.\n\nWill continue to provide supportive care.\n\nNursing note 1900-0700\nInfant admitted via NICU team from L&D. Please see Neonatology attending note for hx and details. Infant placed upon warmer. VSS per flow sheet. DS=72. IV fluids started at 8cc/kg/hr. CBC sent and blood culture drawn and sent. Blood cultures and labs pending. Erythromycin given x1 dose. Vit K and erythrocytes given per protocol. Baby meds given. Parents updated by team. Mom held baby briefly and breastfed x1. Plan to transfer infant back to L&D for further monitoring.\n\nNeonatology Attending Addendum\n\nI spoke with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 121**] [**Doctor Last Name 121**] regarding the possibility that this infant might have sustained some type of injury during vaginal delivery. I am aware that she was unable to feel the posterior portion of her pelvis when she was pushing down. Her husband reportedly witnessed the event. In addition, it was thought that perhaps the infant may have experienced compression of his neck between the symphysis pubis and coccyx during delivery. Given all of these circumstances I decided to ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 213**] to examine the infant again. When he examined him he found that the anterior aspect of the right clavicle remained somewhat thickened compared to the left. However, there appeared to be less difference in thickness than before. Also, the neck looked better than it previously did; although there still appeared to be some degree of torticollis. Finally, the right shoulder blade seemed to appear higher up in comparison to the left side. All of these changes suggest that either the child was injured earlier than we originally thought or that something else is causing this presentation. Therefore, we have decided to do a full set of investigations including additional head and spine MRIs, another echo, and a lumbar puncture to look into other potential causes of the presenting symptoms. We hope that this information will help us come to an accurate diagnosis so that we can treat appropriately. At the very least, we want to reassure parents that their son does not have anything immediately life threatening wrong with him."}

Patient has extensive past med hx including HIV, HTN, DMII, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, cocaine abuse, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted at OSH for chest pain on [**9-6**]. His troponin was negative, but his BP was 167/78. At this time he received 1mg IV nitro, which decreased his BP down to the 130's systolic. He also had an echocardiogram showing LV dysfunction, but good function in all other areas. The following day his pain returned and he became hypotensive. He was given another dose of nitro, but it did no improve his condition. An angio was done and showed that there were several small vessels with thrombus. It is believed that he may have developed a STEMI while receiving the nitroglycerins. After being intubated at OSH, patient went into ventricular fibrillations. He was defibed x 2 times and then went into pulseless VT and died. He remained dead for approx 15 min when spontaneous rhythm started back up. He had been extubated earlier in the shift.

He had been discharged home from hospital after his initial CABG x 3 procedure on [**1-26**].  This time, however, he presented to ED on [**1-28**] for chest pain, nausea and shortness of breath.  His EKG showed elevation of troponins, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 2**].  In the cath lab, he underwent angio showing no evidence of plaque in the left anterior descending artery.  He also developed a new right bundle branch block.  The decision then was made to take him back to the OR today.\nHe did well overnight, but this morning became hypotensive, bradycardic and hypoxemic.  He required several fluid resuscitations and neo titrations before being able to wean off pressors.  After turning him over into a reverse Trendelenburg position, he was able to come off the neo and return to a supine position.  He continues to be slightly tachycardic with frequent PVCs.  He was transfused two units PRBCs for a hct of 27.  He is currently receiving insulin infusing at 1 unit/hr via peripheral line.\nReview of Systems:\nNeuro:  Pt is alert and oriented x 3, cooperative with care.  MAEs spontaneously.
