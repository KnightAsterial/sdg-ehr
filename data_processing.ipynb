Attempted to bring L arm to ETT. (now restrained)\\n\\nSKIN: has stapled incisions on legs, open to air and w/out evidence of infection. NS wet->dry dsg on both feet, necrotic areas noted on R toes and R lateral foot, L foot w/ clean open lateral ulceration and L heel ulceration. + dopplerable pulses both DP per vascular surgeon today.\\n\\nID: afebrile. On abx.\\n\\nSOCIAL: His family is here: wife and 6 of the 7 children. His son is [**Name2 (NI) 6**] from CA. They have spoken w/ myself, the intern and attending physician and seem to understand pt\\'s condition.\\n\\nASSESS: stable w/ one noted run VT today. Tolerating tapering levofed.\\nNeurological improvement. Good oxygenation. Good ventilatory support.\\nPoor cardiac function. Potential for more lethal arrythmias.\\n\\nPLAN: cont to wean pressors to keep map >60, wean levofed first.\\n  Monitor lytes.\\n\\nMICU NPN 3PM-11PM:\\nNeuro: Pt is restless at times with some movements in all extremities but does not follow my commands to squeeze my hand or open his eyes. Pupils are 4MM equal and reactive to light bilaterally. His sedation had been off since the day shift and he was getting more and more restless and coughing and chewing on the ETT constantly. After discussion with team the decision was made to use PRN ativan boluses which have been effective to keep him more comfortable.\\n\\nResp: Remains on AC 18, TV 600, FIO2 40% with 8cm peep. Good sats. Stable gas. Suctioned frequently in the beginning of the shift. He has mod amts thick pale yellow secretions via the ETT as well as orally. Lungs are coarse.\\n\\nCardiac: Weaned off the levophed by mid-shift. BP 90-130/60. GOAL MAP >60. Also lido drip shut off and pt bolused with amiodarone 150mg then started on infusion of amio at 1mg/min which should be changed to .5mg/min at 11:15PM. He needs the amiodarone at .5mg/min continuously for 18hrs then they will assess if he can be switched to PO regimen. He has had much less ectopy and no runs of VT since starting the amio drip. He tolerated the bolus well without hypotension. His triponin came back greater than 50 today so he is being treated for acute MI. He was given aspirin one tab via the NGT and started on heparin drip. No bolus was given. Infusion started at 6:30PM so he needs PTT at 12:30PM. The heparin sliding scale is in the orders and drip needs to be adjusted according the scale. His swan numbers show SVR 900. CO 5.4. PCW 18-22. He has been getting 500cc\\'s fluid boluses intermittently as ordered by MD and numbers need to be checked one-half hour later.\\n\\nGI: OGT inserted for meds. CXR confirmed good placement. +BS\\n\\nGU: UO 30-40cc/hr. Urine dark cloudy. Grew out yeast in urine and given fluconazole 400mg via OGT.\\n\\nID: Afebrile. WBC down to 18 this evening. Continues on gent/vanco/zosyn. I sent blood culture with fungal isolator tonight as ordered.\\n\\nSkin: Dressing on his right toes and left heal and side of foot changed. Areas look necrotic.\\n\\nSocial: Large family who are very involved. Pt apparently has had poor quality of life recently with mild alzheimer\\'s dementia, poor circulation, neuropathy, diabetes and spent the major part of his life in bed these days. They are comfortable with their decision for DNR and even question whether we should continue to be as aggressive as we are. I can tell they struggle with their decision but reassured them that right now there is no decisions to be made and just give him time to see which direction he goes.\\n\\nNPN addendum:\\nOrder for additional NS bolus 500cc\\'s ordered at 10:30 PM and started. Swan numbers including wedge need to be done one-half hour after this bolus so at 11:30PM. I also gave him a dose of IV calcium that was orderd.\\n\\nResp. Care Note\\nPt intubated and vented on settings AC 600x 14x 40% peep 8. Rate weaned down from 18-16-14 during shift, slight resp. alkalosis on ABG. Sxn for thick blood tinged secretions. ABG pending on current settings, adjust vent as needed.\\n\\nMicu Nursing Progress Note:\\n\\nNeuro: Remains mostly non-responsive, but with periods of wakefulness when he does attempt to communicate with nurse. [**Name2 (NI) **] had two such episodes last night. He did squeeze nurse\\'s hand when asked, using his left hand. Right hand moves on bed only. Both hands are restrained for safety secondary to increased wakefulness, with one attempt on day shift to reach for ET tube.
